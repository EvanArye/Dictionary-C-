# C++ PROGRAMMING 101: DICTIONARY

This is a C++ program that works like a mini dictionary. It stores engineering and science terms such as “ACCELERATION,” “ALGORITHM,” and “AMPLIFIER,” along with their definitions. The code uses a series of ternary operators to directly look up and return the definition for the term you enter, making it both straightforward and efficient.
